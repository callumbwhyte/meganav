A flexible, draggable link picker for constructing site navigation menus, big or small, in Umbraco 7.

## Getting started

This package is supported on Umbraco 7.5+.

### Installation

Meganav is available from Our Umbraco, NuGet, or as a manual download directly from GitHub.

#### Our Umbraco repository
You can find a downloadable package, along with a discussion forum for this package, on the [Our Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.org/projects/website-utilities/meganav/) site.

#### NuGet package repository
To [install from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cogworks.Meganav/), run the following command in your instance of Visual Studio.

    PM> Install-Package Cogworks.Meganav

## Usage

After installing the package, you'll be able to create a new Data Type based on _Cogworks.Meganav_ via the Umbraco backoffice.

Here you can configure the "Max depth" of the navigation - the maximum number of levels deep at which an editor can place nav items.

Now your Data Type is ready, we need to add it to a Document Type. This is done in the usual way - you will find Meganav appears in the "pickers" section when selecting a property to add.

Wow! That was easy! You now have a shiny new navigation picker setup for your content editors to enjoy.

In the backoffice, the design of Meganav closely follows the other pickers in Umbraco to ensure your editor's experience is as familiar as possible.

Click and drag an item to change it's position within the navigation; drop it wherever you choose. Unpublished items will appear faded out and will not show on the front-end of the website.

### Integration

Meganav was designed to be as clean and simple for developers as it is for content editors.
